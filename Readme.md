# Pankkiyhteys

Communicate with Finnish banks using python

## Getting Started

This is an experimental version. Keep in mind there may be bugs and
this software might empty you bank account, eat your cat, etc.

You need to make a contract with your bank to use web services.
Then you get a 10 digit customer id and a 16 digit transfer key
that are needed by this library.
